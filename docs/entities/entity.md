### PlaySound

Takes a table containing the optional parameters fadeIn, pitch, volume and groupName. (Pitch: 1 = Default, 0.5 = half speed, 2 = 2 times faster) (Volume: 0 = Silent, 1 = Full volume)

### SendToServer

SendToServer calls a method on the server, when running on the client. It implicitly passes the user as the last parameter.

```lua
local ExampleScript = {}

ExampleScript.Properties = {}

function ExampleScript:ClientInit()
 self:GetEntity():SendToServer("Test")
end

function ExampleScript:Test(entity)
 print(entity:GetName()) -- This will print `userEntity1234`
end

return ExampleScript
```

### PlayTimeline 

The following example shows a simple timeline with three positions over a ten second timeline. This will play once when the code is executed. Each change of position is interpolated with EaseInOut.


self:GetEntity():PlayTimeline(
  0.0,                   -- time of first position
  Vector.New(0, 0, 0),   -- first position
  5.0,
  Vector.New(0, 0, 100),
  "EaseInOut",
  10.0,
  Vector.New(100, 0, 100),
  "EaseInOut"
)
The following example shows a timeline which changes both position and rotation of the script's entity.

```lua
self:GetEntity():PlayTimeline(
  0.0,
  Vector.New(0, 0, 0),
  Rotation.New(0, 0, 0),
  1.0,
  Vector.New(0, 0, 100),
  Rotation.New(180, 0, 0)
)
```

The following example shows a timeline which simulates a bouncing ball by moving linearly in the X axis but using EaseOut on the up movement and EaseIn on the down movement to simulate the top of a bounce.

```lua
self:GetEntity():PlayTimeline(
  0.0,
  Vector.New(0, 0, 0),
  1.0,
  Vector.New(100, 0, 100),
  { z = "EaseOut", },
  2.0,
  Vector.New(200, 0, 0),
  { z = "EaseIn", }
)
```

You can pass the values to PlayTimeline as a table, allowing for procedural generation of a path. This example generates a circlulr path by appending times and positions to a table, and then passes the resulting table to PlayTimeline

```lua
local timeline = {}
for time = 0, 8 do
  -- insert time of this keyframe into the timeline table
  table.insert(timeline, time)
  -- insert position into timeline table using some maths to make a circle
  table.insert(timeline,
    Vector.New(
      100 * math.cos(time * math.pi / 4),
      -100 * math.sin(time * math.pi / 4),
      0
       )
  )
end
self:GetEntity():PlayTimeline(timeline)
```

### onInteract

The onInteract event is sent when a player iteracts with the entity. 

```lua
ExampleScript.Properties = {
  { name = "entityToInteractWith", type = "entity" }
}

function ExampleScript:Init()
  self.properties.entityToInteractWith.onInteract:Listen(self, "HandleInteraction")
end

function ExampleScript:HandleInteraction(player, hitResult, entity)
  print("The player that interacted was " .. player:GetName())
  print("The interaction was at " .. hitResult:GetPosition)
  print("The entity that was interacted with was " .. entity:GetName())
end
```
