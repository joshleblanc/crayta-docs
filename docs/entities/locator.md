# Locator

Locator is a physical [Entity](entity) which doesn't render anything but can have its position and rotation queried. It can be used as a start location for spawning (see SpawnPlayer) Locator derives from Entity so if you have a Locator you can do any of these functions as well as the functions in Entity. You can do entity:IsA(Locator) to see if a particular entity variable is a Locator type entity.
