| IsPlaying()                        | boolean     | returns true if this animation is still playing                                                                                                          | None |
| GetPlaybackSpeed()                 | number      | get the current playback speed of the animation                                                                                                          | None |
| SetPlaybackSpeed(number speed)     | None        | set the current playback speed of the animation                                                                                                          | None |
| IsLooping()                        | boolean     | get whether this animation is set to loop                                                                                                                | None |
| SetLooping(bool looping)           | None        | set whether this animation should loop	                                                                                                                  | None |
| Stop()                             | None        | stops/cancels the animation on this mesh, this will invalidate this handle as the animation it relates to is no longer playing                           | None |
| SetProgress(number normalizedTime) | None        | Set the progress of the animation. 0.0 = the start of the animation, 0.5 = 50% of the way through the animation, 1.0 = the end of the animation, etc     | None |
| GetProgress()                      | number      | Returns the progress of the animation. 0.0 = the start of the animation, 0.5 = 50% of the way through the animation, 1.0 = the end of the animation, etc |      |
