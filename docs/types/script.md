## Examples

### OnUserLogin

When OnUserLogin is registered, it disables automatically spawning the player.

```lua

ExampleScript.Properties = {
  { name = "spawnLocator", type = "entity" },
  { name = "playerTemplate", type "template" }
}

function ExampleScript:OnUserLogin(user)
  user:SpawnPlayerWithEffect(self.properties.playerTemplate, self.properties.spawnLocator)
end
```

### Schedule

Spawn an enemy every 10 seconds

```lua
ExampleScript.Properties = {
 { name = "enemySpawnFrequency", type = "number", default = 10 },
 { name = "enemyTemplate", type = "template" }
}

function ExampleScript:SpawnEnemies()
 self.enemySpawnScheduleHandle = self:Schedule(function()
  while true do
   Wait(self.properties.enemySpawnFrequency)

   local enemyObj = GetWorld():Spawn(self.properties.enemyTemplate, self:GetEntity():GetPosition(), self:GetEntity():GetRotation())
  end
 end)
end
```


### SendToServer

SendToServer calls a method on the server, when running on the client. It implicitly passes the user as the last parameter.

```lua
local ExampleScript = {}

ExampleScript.Properties = {}

function ExampleScript:ClientInit()
 self:SendToServer("Test")
end

function ExampleScript:Test(entity)
 print(entity:GetName()) -- This will print `userEntity1234`
end

return ExampleScript
```
