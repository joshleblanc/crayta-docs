## Examples

### ApplyPointDamage

DamageModifiers is a table of 

```
{ 
    voxel = [VoxelAsset](voxelAsset), 
    damageMultiplier = number 
} 
```

tables, and/or scripts that have voxel and damageMultiplier properties: `{ name = "voxel", type = "voxelasset" } and { name = "damageMultiplier", type = "number" }`:

```
damageModifiers = { 
    { voxel = [VoxelAsset](voxel_asset), damageMultiplier = number }, 
    { voxel = [VoxelAsset](voxel_asset), damageMultiplier = number }, 
    [Script](script), 
    [Script](script) 
}
```

### SetVoxelProperties

VoxelProperties is a table of `{ voxel = <voxelasset>, health = <number>, healTime = <number> }` tables, and/or scripts that have voxel, and optionally health and healTime properties: `{ name = "voxel", type = "voxelasset" }, { name = "health", type = "number", default = 100 }, { name = "healTime", type = "number", editor = "seconds", default = 3 }. voxelProperties = { { voxel = <voxelasset>, health = <number>, healTime = <number> }, { voxel = <voxelasset>, health = <number> }, { voxel = <voxelasset>, healTime = <number> }, <script>, <script> }` Defaults are 100 for health, 3.0 for heal time.

### GetActiveChallenges

Example result table: 

```
result = {} 
result[1] = {id = <ChallengeId>, name = <LocalisedName>, icon = <IconUrl>, count = <TotalCountToComplete>} result[2] = {id...
```

### ForEachUser

```lua
function ExampleScript:DespawnAllPlayers()
    GetWorld():ForEachUser(function(userEntity)
        userEntity:DespawnPlayerWithEffect()
    end)
end
```
